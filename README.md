# mobile_listing_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Demonstrate the memory management and image cache optimization technique

Assume you have a network image with a resolution of 2200 X 1800 and a size of approximately 8MB. In your application, however, you only want to show a thumbnail version of it in a constrainedBox with height and width of 100px. The original image dimensions are very huge for our needs here.

Flutter Image Renderer works by caching the full-resolution image in memory and taking up the entire 8MB image size space. Consider displaying a list of 300 such images, and the total memory adds up to 2.4GB, which is enough to cause your app to crash on iOS 15, which has a memory heap limit of 2098MBs.

This problemÂ can be solved by addingÂ cacheÂ height and cache width. For example, if a responsive widget has a maximum size of 200 X 150, appropriate cache parameters must be given. The flutterÂ rendered then just caches the image's specific resolution, regardless of the original size. 

eg:
```
Image.network("url",cacheHeight:140,cacheWidth:140),

```
